# Configuration

## Controller Settings

The controller is installed into Kubernetes with reasonable defaults. However, there are some settings that can be overridden using environment variables in [`controller.yaml`](../deploy/500-controller.yaml).

The following environment variables are available:

| Environment Variable                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Role-based Access Control

The release deployment YAML file includes two cluster-wide roles for using Shipwright Build objects.
The following roles are installed:

- `shpwright-build-aggregate-view`: this role grants read access (get, list, watch) to most Shipwright Build objects.
  This includes `BuildStrategy`, `ClusterBuildStrategy`, `Build`, and `BuildRun` objects.
  This role is aggregated to the [Kubernetes "view" role].
- `shipwright-build-aggregate-edit`: this role grants write access (create, update, patch, delete) to Shipwright objects that are namespace-scoped.
  This includes `BuildStrategy`, `Builds`, and `BuildRuns`.
  Read access is granted to all `ClusterBuildStrategy` objects.
  This role is aggregated to the [Kubernetes "edit" and "admin" roles].

Only cluster administrators are granted write access to `ClusterBuildStrategy` objects.
This can be changed by creating a separate [Kubernetes `ClusterRole`] with these permissions and binding the role to appropriate users.

## Git Source Step Settings

Environment variables for the Git Source Step need to be set via the respective container template, see `GIT_CONTAINER_TEMPLATE` for reference.

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GIT_SHOW_LISTING`   | Specify whether a file listing of the source step is printed, disabled by default. Use `true` to enable a file listing. |

## Bundle Source Step Settings

Environment variables for the Bundle Source Step need to be set via the respective container template, see `BUNDLE_CONTAINER_TEMPLATE` for reference.

| Environment Variable  | Description                                                                                                             |
