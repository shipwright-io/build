                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.

                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.

                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.

                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                                to the PVC after it has been created.

                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                            The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                            - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                            - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                            - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                            The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                            A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                            The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                            The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                            The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                            Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                            The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                Policy for pulling OCI objects. Possible values are:
                                Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                Behaves in the same way as pod.spec.containers[*].image.
                                Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                    ephemeral:
                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.

                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.

                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                            Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.

                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.

                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.

                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.

                            The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                            A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                            The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                            The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                            The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                            Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                            The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                Policy for pulling OCI objects. Possible values are:
                                Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                                      ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field
                                      of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.

                                      Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.

                                      ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
                                      combination of signer name and a label selector.

                                      Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                                      into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                      comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                      The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                      may change the order over time.

                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                Use this if:
                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                of an individual pod.

                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                more information.

                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                persistent volumes at the same time.
                              properties:

                                    Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                    The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                    owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                    pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                    `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                    entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                    is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                    will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                    volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                    meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                    owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                    this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                    manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                              specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                              in any namespaces.

                                image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                                The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                    Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                    Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.

                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.

                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                            This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                            to the PVC after it has been created.

                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,

                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      description: |-
                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                            Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.

                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.

                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.

                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,

                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                            The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                            - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                            - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                            - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                            The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                            A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                            The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                            The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                            The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                            Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                            The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.
